Description: Clustering is a central task in big data analyses and clusters are often Gaussian or near Gaussian. However, a flexible Gaussian cluster simulation tool with precise control over the size, variance, and spacing of the clusters in NXN dimensional space does not exist. This is why we created 'clusterlab'. The algorithm first creates X points equally spaced on the circumference of a circle in 2D space. These form the centers of each cluster to be simulated. Additional samples are added by adding Gaussian noise to each cluster center and concatenating the new sample co-ordinates. Then if the feature space is greater than 2D, the generated points are considered principal component scores and projected into N dimensional space using linear combinations using fixed eigenvectors. Through using vector rotations and scalar multiplication clusterlab can generate complex patterns of Gaussian clusters and outliers.
